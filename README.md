# UDACITY IMAGE PROCESSING

---
# PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project aims is a real-world scenario in which you would read and write to your disk via a Node.js express server rather than a database. The project you serves two purposes: setting up scalable code and architecture for real-world projects and tie together some of the most popular middleware and utilities found in Node.js projects. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible but proves my ability to use what Iâ€™ve learned in real-world scenarios.

# PROJECT TASKS

The main goal is to build an Image Processing API. In this project you will:
* Initialize your project
* Set up your project structure
* Set up your server and create an API endpoint
* Install Sharp and configure endpoint
* Write your tests
* Add caching
* Test, Debug, and Refactor
